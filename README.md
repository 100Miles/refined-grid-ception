# Refined grid-ception

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Copy the `index.html`, `images` and `css` from your `grid-ception` assignment into this folder—**DO NOT overwrite whole folder.**
- Add `type.css` into this website.
- Changing only the HTML by adding Typografier classes, fix the spacing and sizing around elements.
- You shouldn’t need to touch your `main.css` file at all—it should remain exactly as you had it before.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
